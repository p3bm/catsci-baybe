BayBE Bayesian Optimizer

Issue with DesirabilityObjective throwing an error when recommending new reactions from existing data.

Todo:
+ Try swapping DesirabilityObjective for ParetoObjective and see if the issue persists.
+ Try without passing a recommender to the Campaign and see what the default behaviour is.
+ Try running script locally rather than through the deployed Streamlit app.
+ Try recreating the bare minimum example that gives rise to the error to then submit an issue on Github.
